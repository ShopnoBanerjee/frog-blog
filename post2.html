            <h1>Machine Learning Models</h1>

            <p>Machine learning models are computer programs that recognize patterns in data and make decisions based on unknown datasets. For example, in image recognition, an ML model can learn to recognize objects like cars or dogs. In natural language processing, ML models can interpret and analyze human language.</p>

            <p>These ML models are created using ML algorithms and trained on labeled, unlabeled, or mixed data depending on their future goal.</p>

            <h2>What is a Machine Learning Algorithm?</h2>

            <p>A machine learning algorithm is a mathematical method used to find patterns in a dataset. These algorithms are often derived from statistics, calculus, and linear algebra. Some popular ML algorithms include:</p>

            <ul>
                <p>Linear Regression</p>
                <p>Decision Trees</p>
                <p>Random Forest</p>
                <p>XGBoost</p>
            </ul>

            <p>During training, the algorithm is optimized to recognize certain patterns or outputs in a given dataset. Over time, it improves its classification or prediction accuracy, ultimately becoming a trained ML model.</p>

            <h2>Types of Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <img class="blog-post-image" src="assets/post2/learning.png" alt="Description of image">

            <h3>Supervised Machine Learning</h3>

            <p>In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data. Some common supervised learning algorithms include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Determines whether an input belongs to a particular group.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> Classifies data points using a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space.</li>
                <li><strong>Naive Bayes:</strong> Uses probability to classify objects based on independent features.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Splits data into different branches to make classifications.</li>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Predicts numerical values based on input variables.</li>
                <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):</strong> Classifies data points based on the closest neighbors.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> Uses multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Boosting Algorithms:</strong> Methods like XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines, and LightGBM that combine multiple weak models to form a stronger model.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h3>

            <p>Unsupervised learning models find patterns in unlabeled data. Some common algorithms include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> Groups data into K clusters based on similarities.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering:</strong> Builds a tree-like structure of nested clusters.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The best machine learning model depends on the problem being solved. For example, to predict the number of vehicle purchases in a city, a supervised learning method like linear regression would be suitable.</p>

            <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <img class="blog-post-image" src="assets/post2/reinforcement.png" alt="Description of image">

            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of ML where an agent learns to interact with an environment through trial and error. RL systems receive rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect ones.</p>

            <p>A well-known example of RL is autonomous driving, where a model continuously learns to make better decisions based on real-world interactions.</p>

            <h3>Key Components of Reinforcement Learning</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The world in which the agent operates.</li>
                <li><strong>State:</strong> The current situation of the agent.</li>
                <li><strong>Reward:</strong> Feedback from the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy:</strong> The method for mapping states to actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Value:</strong> The expected future reward for taking a certain action.</li>
                <li><strong>Function Approximator:</strong> A method for estimating a function, such as decision trees or neural networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Markov Decision Process (MDP):</strong> A framework for decision-making in probabilistic environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Programming (DP):</strong> Solves sequential decision problems using a compositional cost structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):</strong> Uses policies to estimate the best course of action.</li>
                <li><strong>Q-Learning:</strong> Learns the value of actions through exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Q-Networks:</strong> Uses neural networks for RL-based decision-making.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications of Reinforcement Learning</h2>

            <p>RL has many real-world applications, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Robotics for industrial automation.</li>
                <li>AI-based game playing.</li>
                <li>Self-driving cars.</li>
                <li>Automated trading in finance.</li>
                <li>Personalized education systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Machine learning models play a crucial role in modern technology, enabling computers to make decisions, recognize patterns, and automate processes. Choosing the right ML algorithm depends on the type of data and the desired outcome.</p>

            <p>From supervised and unsupervised learning to reinforcement learning, ML techniques continue to shape industries like healthcare, finance, robotics, and AI-driven decision-making.</p>
